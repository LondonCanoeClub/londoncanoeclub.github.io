**Q: Do you have kayaks?**  
A: Yes!

**Q: Do I need any canoeing/kayaking experience to join?**  
A: No, you don't need any prior experience to come out and try paddling! If you'd like some tips to get you started, or have a particular paddling skill you'd like to improve, we do offer [lessons](/learn-to-paddle/) throughout the season.

**Q: Do I need to bring anything with me?**  
A: We provide the canoe or kayak, paddles, PDFs, and safety kits (government-required whistle, rope, and bailer). You should bring any personal items you might need- we recommend sun protection, comfortable footwear for the walk from the parking lot to the dock, and drinking water (there are no taps at the site). We also recommend that you avoid bringing or wearing anything that can't get wet, or that you put items in a watertight container (not provided by the club).

**Q: Are there washrooms?**  
A: There are vault toilets in both parking lots at Sharon Creek.

**Q: Can I bring kids and pets?**  
A: Yes! We have children's life jackets in a range of sizes. Pets are welcome but must be on leash in the conservation area. We don't have any dog life jackets available to borrow.

**Q: Can I reserve a canoe/kayak for a specific time?**  
A: Sorry, boats are taken out on a first-come-first-served basis. However, there are usually some boats available, so if the type of boat you're hoping to borrow isn't available when you arrive, it's a great opportunity to try something new!

**Q: I don't want to join. Can I just rent a canoe/kayak?**  
A: Sorry, we are entirely a membership-based organization. However, our annual rate (which includes parking) is comparable to day-use admission plus a single canoe/kayak rental session at many other venues, so we hope you'll consider joining!
