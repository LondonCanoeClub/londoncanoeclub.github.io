The London Canoe Club operates out of Sharon Creek Conservation Area, located at 4212 Springer Rd, Delaware, ON. When you arrive at Sharon Creek, take the trail leading from the north parking lot, take the first right and choose either direction at the fork, then turn right again when the trail rejoins the larger trail. Continue until you see the club's shipping containers.
