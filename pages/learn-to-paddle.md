## Canoe Lessons
If you'd like some canoeing instruction either to get you started or to improve existing skills, you can schedule an individual or group coaching session with a certified canoeing instructor. The cost is a pay-what-you-can donation to the club. Email [{{ site.lesson_email }}](mailto:{{ site.lesson_email }}) to arrange a time!
