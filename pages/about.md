The London Canoe Club is a volunteer-run organization operating out of London, Ontario, Canada focused on recreational paddling. The club maintains a fleet of canoes and kayaks which can be borrowed by members during operating hours and used in the Sharon Creek Conservation Area reservoir.

You'll need to show your membership card to borrow a canoe or kayak, and memberships cannot be processed in person.
