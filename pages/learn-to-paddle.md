## Basic Kayaking Skills Sessions
Looking for some pointers for your first time kayaking, or ready to take 
your paddling to the next level? Join our kayaking instructor for a small 
group skills session! You'll learn the skills you need to get your kayak 
moving in the direction you want safely and efficiently.



Sessions run for 3 hours and are limited to 6 participants, so register early! 
You must be a member of the London Canoe Club to sign up for a session, and 
the cost is a goodwill donation to the club. Please send donations by 
etransfer to {{ site.membership_email }}

We have not yet scheduled kayaking classes for 2024. Please check back for updates!

## Canoe Skills Sessions
If you'd like some canoeing instruction either to get you started or to
improve existing skills, you can schedule a coaching
session with a certified canoeing instructor.

Sessions can be for one or more tandem (two people per boat) or solo (one person per boat) canoes at a time.

Sessions are provided to club members by goodwill donation to the club. Please send donations by
e-transfer to {{ site.membership_email }}

Please check back for updates about the start of 2024 canoe coaching sessions!
