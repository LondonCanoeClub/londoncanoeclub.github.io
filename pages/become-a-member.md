Membership applications are now open for the 2025 season! Memberships are valid until the end of the year.

### Prices:  
$55 individual adult  
$65 two adults with no dependents  
$70 family (two adults with dependents under 18 years of age)

Membership benefits include use of the canoes and kayaks during operating hours (one boat per adult member at a time). Members may bring guests who may paddle together in their canoe or take turns using a kayak.

Please note that canoe club memberships **do not** include a parking pass for Sharon Creek Conservation Area. Parking can be purchased separately through the Lower Thames Valley Conservation Authority - [please click here for more information about parking]({{ site.parking_info }}).

### To Become a Member: 
1. Fill out the application form below
2. Check your email for your membership card. Print or bring an electronic copy of your membership card to show when signing out a boat. Please note that if you have purchased a family or partner membership recently, it may list only the name of the purchasing member and include a QR code link to the names of the other members in your family. If your family or partner membership card has a QR code, please scan it and screenshot or save a copy of the screen to expedite the boat sign-out process for additional members.
